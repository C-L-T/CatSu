# CatSu
A custom Osu! server I'm developing from the old [Ripple](https://github.com/osuripple) code, credits to the Ripple dev team (Nyo / Howl / Avail) for making this possible. CatSu currently uses the following from Ripple:
* __Bancho__ (c.ppy.sh) - The basics woork such as login, spectating, FokaBot and multiplayer
* __Old-Frontend__ (osu.ppy.sh) - The old, old version of the Ripple website, pretty much everything important works apart from a few things which will be included in the To-Do list
* __Avatar Server__ (a.ppy.sh) - It runs but avatars do not work on the site or in game, config error? Will fix
* __Lets__ - Runs fine but the game still uses score to rank players?
* __Ripple Python Common__ - Common code used to link Bancho and Lets but is currently only used for Lets as Bancho is outdated

# To-Do (25/09/17)
* Add LICENSE to repo
* Fix avatar server
* Update Bancho to work with Lets
* Add beatmap ranking from the Admin Panel
* Overhaul the site

I'm looking for people who would be happy to help out with this project, I think there is a lack of custom Osu! servers available and I want to try and develop a new and different Osu! server and if you're willing to help out, please get in touch with me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QWCxSp2).

Once again, huge thanks to the guys from the Ripple-Dev team, take a look at these links:
* Ripple: https://ripple.moe
* Ripple Discord: https://discord.gg/2cTPzzz
* Ripple GitHub: https://github.com/osuripple

We're using an MIT [license](https://github.com/C-L-T/CatSu/blob/master/LICENSE), the same as Ripple which allows you to do basically anything with the code. 

Thanks!
